## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I learned to use css custom properties.
I also dove a little deeper info semantic html elements and understood them more fully.

### Continued development

For the next project:

- Review my knowledge about semantic HTML markup
- Be more thoughtful when planning out the HTML structure
- Read more on useful cases of grid and flexbox usage - when to use which and how to decide

For future (in general):

- Learn more about accessibility
- Learn more about responsiveness
